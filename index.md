# Arduino Based Floor Cleaning Robot
This project uses an arduino to control a floor cleaning a robot. It utilizes an ultrasonic sensor to know when to stop and turn,and uses 4 DC motors and a motor driver to control the movement. A vacuum and a brush are attached to the car to clean the floor.

# Final Milestone
My final milestone is the increased reliability and accuracy of my robot. I ameliorated the sagging and fixed the reliability of the finger. As discussed in my second milestone, the arm sags because of weight. I put in a block of wood at the base to hold up the upper arm; this has reverberating positive effects throughout the arm. I also realized that the forearm was getting disconnected from the elbow servo’s horn because of the weight stress on the joint. Now, I make sure to constantly tighten the screws at that joint.

# First Milestone
My first milestone was getting my wiring set up for the motor driver and motors, and the ultrasonic sensor. I also wanted to test the range of the ultrasonic sensor and calibrate it properly. Lastly, I completed the assembly of the chassis of the car as well. I got my ultrasonic sensor wire to the arduino and test it properly with a set of code. Afterwards, I assembled the chassis of the car and put the motors on the wheels. Then, I moved onto to the DC motors and the motor driver. I hooked up the motors to the motor driver and tested the motors going both forwards and backwards. Now I felt confident with the parts that I had, and was ready to move on.
